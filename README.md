#ArduinoPlantMonitor
Arduino plant monitoring system is a group project from four computer science students at Malm√∂ University.

The project uses an arduino equipped with soilmoisture, humidity, light and temperature sensors to measure values from a potted plant. The values are sent to a server, which stores them in a database for clients to retrieve. The client then presents the data using graphs. 
This way, users will have a digital representation of the plants enviroment. The plants needs can be easily observed and the user can adjust its water and light exposure accordingly.
